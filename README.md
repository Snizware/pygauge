# pygauge
Sizeable, customizable gauges that work with pygame.  Define colored arcs, change needle color by value, rotate the gauge.

I intend to put this to use on my Raspberry Pi for use in displaying flight telemetry.
It could be paired with OBD to display automotive data or even used for games.
Feel free to use it as you see fit. Hopefully it comes in handy.
